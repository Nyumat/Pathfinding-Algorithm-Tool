# A* Pathfinding Visualization Tool [WIP]

- The Maintainer of this Repository: Thomas or "Nyumat"

## What the Tool is
 
 This tool is an interactive, easy to use visualization of the popular A* search algorithm. 
 
 The tool uses the GUI and Keyboard Key access that comes with pygame and creates a plan where "nodes" are to be placed which are essentially points on a grid that, when the program is ran executes the algorithm and displays a optimal  path to the other node. 
 
 This tool is written in Python with the GUI/Alogrithm being developed entirely using the pygame module. 
 
 ## Features 
 
 *some of these features aren't completely implemented yet, as you can see in the code* :/
 
 - Unlimited placeable nodes
 - Colorful GUI
 - Grid Canvas
 - Barriers
 - One click execution usng pygame
