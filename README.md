### My Approach towards the Cliche Algorithm Visualization Tool *Everyone* seems to be doing as a side-project nowadays.


This is the approach I took towards building an A* Visualization Script. 

 *Source Code Written in Python and Pygame. 
 
This specific version of the popular path search algorithm is implemented quite efficiently especially considering I self taught the algo through internet blogs.

The code runs at the Debugging of the script, so feel free to try it out yourself. :p
