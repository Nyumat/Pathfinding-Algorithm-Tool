# My Approach at the Cliche Algorithm Visualization Tool


This is the approach I took towards building an A* Visualization Script. 
 >Written in Python and Pygame. 
The popular path search algorithm is implemented quite efficiently especially considering I self taught the algo through internet blogs.
It runs at the Debugging of the script, so feel free to try it out.
